# Structured community transitions explain the switching behavior of microbial systems

This repository contains the code and data associated with the manuscript: Chengyi Long, Jie Deng, Jen Nguyen, Yang-Yu Liu, Eric J. Alm, Ricard Sol√©, Serguei Saavedra. Structured community transitions explain the switching behavior of microbial systems.

The repository contains 3 folders: code, data and figs. Under code we provide the R code to reproduce results in the main text, mainly Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. Each code file is an independent script that can be executed directly and print its corresponding figure.

code/toolbox.R provides all the functions needed. It has four major parts aligned with the manuscript. Parameter space geometry generates feasible partitions from model-free and model-driven approach; Information theory analyzes the transition processes; Gravity model constructs theoretical transitions; Empirical time series constructs empirical transitions.
